# JavaMemoryManagement

This is a demo project about how we can handle menmory management in java with immutable and mutable references.
It also covers the garbage collection and its functioning 
one can refer this to understand stack and heap memory allocation
I will upgrade this project time to time and you too can contribute to it if intersted.
